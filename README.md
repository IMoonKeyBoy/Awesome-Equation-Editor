Emath Editor: A Easy LaTeX Formula Editor!
========



Introduction
-----
* Emath Editor was born to solve the problems of complex formula script and confused structure when users edit LaTeX formula. It can simplify the process of formula editing and make user edit formula more efficient. It is based on the TeX script library, so you need to install and configure the TeX environment. Here is the download link [downloade](http://tug.org/mactex/).
* To make it easier to use, we set Emath to "Application is Agent" (UIElement), which is much more convenient in the use process and does not require window switching back and forth.This is his interface.
