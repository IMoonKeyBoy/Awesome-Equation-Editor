# Emath Editor: A Easy LaTeX Formula Editor!

[English](README.md) | [中文](README-zh.md)

## Introduction

- Emath Editor was born to solve the problems of complex formula script and confused structure when users edit LaTeX formula. It can simplify the process of formula editing and make user edit formula more efficient. It is based on the TeX script library, so you need to install and configure the TeX environment. Here is the download link [download](http://tug.org/mactex/).
- To make it easier to use, we set Emath to "Application is Agent" (UIElement), which is much more convenient in the use process and does not require window switching back and forth.It looks like this.

- If you want to use it, simply click the formula element button, or add some simple elements with the keyboard, and then click "Preview" button.It will show the formula image. If you need to copy the TeX script to the clipboard, you can click the "Copy" button. The "Clear" button is used to empty the edit area.
